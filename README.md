# MY459_text-analysis_project_R

The final summative assessment for MY459 is a written analysis of approximately 3,000 words, due at the beginning of ST 2020, which forms 40% of the course grade.

The project replaces a final exam and is designed to give you a chance to analyze a set of texts that you have chosen, reflecting (hopefully) your own research interests. This can be, and probably makes the most sense to be, textual data from something you are already studying. Which texts you choose, what question you investigate, and how you analyze the texts is your choice, but you must justify the choice.
